# FreeCodeCamp-Projects

You can find here all of my Certification projects required by FreeCodeCamp for the Certifications. 

I try to make each project more personal and deepened by adding additional functionnalities such as automatised translation, day/night mode button, carousel, graphs... 
You can find the detailed documentation in a Readme file on each project.
