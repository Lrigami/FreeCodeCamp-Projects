# FreeCodeCamp-Projects

You can find here all of my Certification projects required by FreeCodeCamp for the Certifications. 

I try to make each project more personal and deepened by adding additional functionnalities such as automatised translation, day/night mode button, carousel, graphs... 
You can find the detailed documentation in a Readme file on each project. 

## What are the asked Certification Projects ?

1. A Form
2. A Tribute Page (added functionnalities : carousel, automatised translation)
3. A Technical Documentation Page (added : graphs, day/night mode button)
4. Product Landing Page
5. Personal Portfolio Page
