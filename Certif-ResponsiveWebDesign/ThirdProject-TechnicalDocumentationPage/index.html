                    <p>JLPT stands for Japanese Language Proficiency Test.</p> 

                <h3 id="Sec1h31">Description</h3>
                    <p>The Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) has been offered by the Japan Foundation and Japan Educational Exchanges and Services (JEES) since 1984, for native and non-native speakers.</p>
                    <p>In 2010 the test was revised by the Japan Foundation and Japan Educational Exchanges and Services. Over time, test applicants became diversified and the JLPT was included in the professional sphere.</p>

                <h3 id="Sec1h32">Levels and Test Sections</h3>
                    <p>The JLPT measures both practical Japanese communicative competence and knowledge of the Japanese language. The test includes categories such as vocabulary in context, kanji, grammar, reading comprehension and oral comprehension.</p>
                    <p>Before 2010, the test was divided in 4 levels (N4, N3, N2 and N1). In 2010, a new level was included between the last N3 and N2 levels because the level gap was too important.</p>
                    <p>The table below shows the corresponding levels of the new test to that of the past test.</p>
