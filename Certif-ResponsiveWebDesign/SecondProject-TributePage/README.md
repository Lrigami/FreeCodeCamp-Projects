What I want to add to this project to make it more personal and deepened :

- [x] Being able to choose the language of the page. The text will change automatically. --> Use of the free version of DeepL API (problems of CrossOrigin for now)
- [x] Design a better timeline : on the left the bio aspects, on the right the literary ones. 
- [x] Add a sliding div that contains the published books by the author. Users can scroll right or left.
- [x] Add a better design so the colors are matching. Put the photo of Ogawa YÃ´ko and the sliding div in a asymetric frame.
- [ ] Responsive design
